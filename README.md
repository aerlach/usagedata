# Usage Data

The usage data monitors what is being used and when (timestamp), including:
* System information, such as Browser, Locale, and UIThread
* Commands and actions accessed via menus, toolbars, or keyboard shortcuts
* View and editor open, close, and activation events (activations occur when a view or editor is given focus)

This usage data is not tied to any personal information about the user. Only the RAP connection identifier is stored.
